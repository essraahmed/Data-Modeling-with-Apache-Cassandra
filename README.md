### Introduction
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

They'd like a data engineer to create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions, and wish to bring you on the project.

### Project Dataset

There's one dataset: event_data. The directory of CSV files partitioned by date. 
Here are examples of filepaths to two files in the dataset:
```
event_data/2018-11-08-events.csv
event_data/2018-11-09-events.csv
```
### Project Template
Project files<br>

1. `event_data`: To process and create a new CSV file in Python.
2. `Project_1B_ Project_Template.ipynb`: The code file.
3. `event_datafile_new.csv`: Dataset to create a denormalized dataset.
4. `images`: contain images.
5. `README.md`: Provides discussion on the project.

### How to run the Python Scripts

Launch `Project_1B_ Project_Template.ipynb` to run.
